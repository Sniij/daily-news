# **제목: "나만 몰랐네"…스타벅스 비싼 음료시켜도 '4000원'**

  내용: 'Starbucks tumbler coupon' is a hot topic. Recently, on social networking services (SNS), there is a discussion on how to eat the entire Starbucks menu for 4,000 won. According to related posts, on platforms for buying and selling second-hand goods, there are 'Starbucks tumbler coupons' being traded for around 4,000 won. If you purchase this coupon and use it at the store, you can order a tall size (355ml) drink without additional charge. You can also add extras like shots or syrups for free up to one item.

For example, if you want to add an espresso shot (800 won) to a Jeju matcha cream Frappuccino (6,500 won), you would have to pay 7,300 won. By using the 4,000 won coupon, you can save around 2-3,000 won. This coupon is originally given as a gift for purchasing a tumbler at Starbucks, but some online sellers are now selling the coupon separately.

In order to use this coupon, you must receive the drink in the tumbler. You cannot receive the drink in a disposable cup. If you order a grande (473ml) or venti (591ml) size drink, you will have to pay an additional charge, and it cannot be applied to some bottled drinks. Experts diagnose the situation where 'eating the entire Starbucks menu for 4,000 won' is a hot topic as a consumer behavior affected by high prices and recession. However, they also warn to be cautious of the fluctuation in coupon prices and potential scam damages.
